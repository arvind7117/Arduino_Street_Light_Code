# Arduino_Street_Light_Code
This repository contains a simple yet effective Arduino sketch for simulating an automatic street light system using an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) sensor. The light automatically turns ON in low-light conditions and OFF in bright conditions, mimicking how real-world street lights operate.
